🌿 Sarthi – Your Mental Wellness Companion

Sarthi is a compassionate AI-powered mental health assisting chatbot designed to support users through stress, anxiety, loneliness, overwhelming thoughts, and emotional struggles.
Acting as a digital companion, Sarthi listens without judgment, understands user mood, and provides calm, comforting, and personalized responses.

Sarthi helps users by:

Identifying mood based on messages.

Offering supportive, empathetic conversations.

Sharing healthy coping strategies for stress, anxiety, and negative thoughts.

Encouraging mindfulness, grounding, and emotional awareness.

Providing motivational and uplifting messages when needed.

Giving international emergency helpline reminders when users express severe distress.

Maintaining privacy, kindness, and non-judgement throughout the interaction.

Sarthi is not a replacement for a therapist, but acts as a friendly guide — a “sarthi”, meaning a helper — to accompany users on their mental wellness journey.
